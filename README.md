# Temperature Converter written in C

This is a simple C program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The program features a text-based interface and is structured with separate files for the main logic and conversion functions.

- The code has been written with seperation of concerns by using `.c` and `.h`files.
- Includes my personal notes on most lines of code as notes and explanation for myself. And I hope for you aswell.
